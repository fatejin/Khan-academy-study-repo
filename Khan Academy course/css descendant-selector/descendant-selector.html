    <p>Colors that carrots come in:</p>
    <ul class="spacey">
      <li>
        <strong class="orange">Orange</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="purple">Purple</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="yellow">Yellow</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Did you know? Carrots were <strong class="purple">purple</strong> before
      the 17th century, but then were cultivated by Dutch farmers until they
      became the sweet orange carrots that we know today.
