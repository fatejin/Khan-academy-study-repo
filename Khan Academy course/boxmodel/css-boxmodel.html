          The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or housecat to
          distinguish it from other felines and felids, is a small domesticated
          carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its companionship and
          ability to hunt vermin and household pests. Cats have been associated
          with humans for at least 9,500 years, and are currently the most
          popular pet in the world. Owing to their close association with
          humans, cats are now found almost everywhere on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible
          bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to
          killing small prey. As nocturnal predators, cats use their acute
          hearing and ability to see in near darkness to locate prey. Not only
          can cats hear sounds too faint for human ears, they can also hear
          sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is because
          cats' usual prey (particularly rodents such as mice) make high
          frequency noises, so cats' hearing has evolved to pinpoint these faint
          high-pitched sounds. Cats rely more on smell than taste, and have a
          vastly better sense of smell than humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species and use a
          variety of vocalizations, pheromones and types of body language for
          communication. These include meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
          growling, and grunting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can
          be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat
          fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and
          neutering and the abandonment of former household pets has resulted in
          problems caused by large numbers of feral cats worldwide, with a
          population of up to 60 million of these animals in the United States
          alone.
